# ADA Project: Racial and Ethnic Differences in Breast Cancer Stage at Diagnosis (SEER 2018–2022)

# Author: Bethel Alemayehu

# Repository Description
This repository contains the R Markdown file and supporting outputs for a cross-sectional analysis examining racial and ethnic differences in stage at diagnosis among women with breast cancer in the United States. The analysis uses population-based data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 registries and evaluates whether stage at diagnosis differs by race and ethnicity after accounting for tumor characteristics and contextual factors.

The repository documents the analytic workflow and results for academic coursework and reproducibility.

# Study Overview
- Population: Women aged ≥18 years with first primary invasive breast cancer  
- Data source: SEER 17 registries  
- Diagnosis years: 2018–2022  
- Outcome: Stage at diagnosis (localized, regional, distant)  
- Primary exposure: Race and ethnicity  
- Analysis: Multinomial logistic regression estimating relative risk ratios (RRRs)  

Cases were restricted at data extraction to those with known race/ethnicity, SEER Summary Stage, and ER, PR, and HER2 status.

# Repository Contents
- "ADA_FINAL_PROJECT.Rmd"" – Main analysis and report  
- "README.md" – Project documentation  
- Output files generated by the R Markdown 

Note: The SEER-derived dataset is not included in this repository due to data use restrictions.

# Software and Packages
Analyses were conducted in R (version ≥ 4.2) using the following packages:

pacman  
readr  
tidyverse  
nnet  
MASS  
funModeling  
brant  
broom  
odds.n.ends  
janitor  
gtsummary  
gt  

# Running the Analysis
1. Open `ADA_FINAL_PROJECT.Rmd` in RStudio  
2. Place the SEER-derived dataset in the same directory or update the file path  
3. Knit the R Markdown file to HTML  

# Notes
Income, rural–urban residence, and marital status were retained using an `Unknown` category rather than listwise deletion.
